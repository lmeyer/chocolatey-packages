## Summary 
You can visit the project page [here](http://snarl.fullphat.net/).

Snarl is all about being notified of events quickly and easily.

## Description 
Snarl is all about notifications. They can be displayed on-screen in a variety of shapes, colours and sizes; they may be spoken out loud, sent to your mobile phone, another computer, and so on. All made possible by an easy-to-implement API that applications use to generate notifications and a simple user interface to manage them. But that’s not all…
